# daily-standup
A dashboard that can be shown at the beginning of each day.

# Getting started

Make a copy of `config.py.sample` called `config.py` and edit as required.

# Running the dashboard

Run: `./start.sh`

This will start a local webserver, generate the index.html and open a browser window.
For remote participants, simply share the screen.
